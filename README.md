Ramen 2.0

main distribution package for Ramen.  includes the [ramen package](https://github.com/RogerLevy/ramen) as a submodule and all dependencies.

todo: move and update the readme, rewrite the docs

current status: many bugfixes, the API is mostly stable but Tiled support may be reworked a bit, also I'm working on a Zelda clone (it's in the [zelda branch](https://github.com/RogerLevy/RamenEngine/tree/zelda) which is the current main development branch of the distro.)
